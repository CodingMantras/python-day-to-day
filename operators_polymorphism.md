# Operator polymorphism

Operator polymorphism is a concept in computer science that refers to the ability of operators (such as +, -) to work with multiple data types.

In other words, the same operator(symbol) can perform different operations based on the type of data it is operating on.

In Python, operator polymorphism is achieved through the use of special methods, such as `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, and `__truediv__`.

These methods are defined in classes to specify how the operator should behave when applied to instances of the class.

For example, the `+` operator can be used to add two numbers, concatenate two strings, or combine two lists.

This is made possible by the `__add__` method, which can be implemented differently for different data types.

Here's an example of adding two numbers:

```python
a = 3
b = 4
c = a + b
print(c)  # Output: 7
```

When the same `+` operator is applied for concatenating two strings look at the output of the code:

```python
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + b
print(c)  # Output: "HelloWorld"

# With numbers as string-literals
x = "5"
b = "2"
c = a + b
print(c)  # Output: 52
```

Here's an example of combining two lists:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
c = a + b
print(c)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

In all of these cases, the + operator is used, but it performs different operations based on the data types it is working with.

This allows for more concise and flexible code, as the same operator can be used to perform similar operations on different data types.

The Python Data Model refers to the way that built-in data types in Python behave and the protocols (such as `__add__`) that they follow. When the + operator is used, the Python interpreter looks for the `__add__` method in the objects being operated on. If the objects define the `__add__` method, the interpreter will call this method to perform the addition.

However, not all main data classes in Python define the `__add__` method. For example, dictionaries nad sets do not define the `__add__` method, so the + operator cannot be used to concatenate dictionaries or sets. In this case, a TypeError will be raised.

Additionally, it is important to note that the behavior of the + operator will depend on the specific data types being operated on.

The `__add__` method can be defined differently for different classes to produce different behavior.
