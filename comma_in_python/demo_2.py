# Question:

t = (1, 2, 3)

# What would be the output of this print statement
print(type(t))

# Ans: <class 'tuple'>
# Correct

# Now
t = 1, 2, 3

# What would be the output of this print statement
print(type(t))

# Ans: <class 'tuple'>

# And also
t = 1,

print(type(t))
# Ans: <class 'tuple'>

# I hope you were not expecting the class int here!
