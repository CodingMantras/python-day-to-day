# issubset method of python sets

The issubset() method in Python sets is used to check whether one set is a subset of another set or not. It returns True if all the elements of the calling set are present in the passed set, otherwise it returns False. In other words, it checks if every element in the calling set is also present in the passed set.

Syntax of issubset() method:

```python
set_a.issubset(set_b)
```

where set_a is the calling set and set_b is the set to be checked against.

For example:

```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3}
set_b = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

print(set_a.issubset(set_b)) # Output: True
```

In this example, set_a is a subset of set_b because all the elements of set_a (1, 2, and 3) are present in set_b. Therefore, issubset() returns True.

Similarly, let's consider another example where set_a is not a subset of set_b:

```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set_b = {1, 2, 3}

print(set_a.issubset(set_b)) # Output: False
```

In this example, set_a is not a subset of set_b as set_a contains an additional element 4 which is not present in set_b. Therefore, it returns False.

Note: If the calling set is equal to the passed set, issubset() returns True. This is because every element in the calling set is also present in the passed set, and vice versa.

```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3}
set_b = {1, 2, 3}

print(set_a.issubset(set_b)) # Output: True
```

The <= operator can also be used to check whether one set is a subset of another set or not, just like the issubset() method. It returns True if all the elements of the calling set are present in the passed set, otherwise it returns False.

Here is the syntax of the subset operator:

```python
set_a <= set_b
```

where set_a is the calling set and set_b is the set to be checked against.

For example:

```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3}
set_b = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

print(set_a <= set_b) # Output: True
```

In conclusion, issubset() method is useful when you need to check if all elements of one set are present in another set or not. It returns a Boolean value True or False depending on whether the calling set is a subset of the passed set or not. The <= operator can be used to achieve the same task as the issubset method.
